# automated-file-sorter

This program is designed to sort files within a specified directory based on their file extensions into separate folders. It first checks if the folders for different file types exist; if not, it creates them. Then, it iterates through the files in the directory and moves them to their respective folders based on their file extensions (e.g., PDF files are moved to the "pdf files" folder, JPG files to the "image files" folder, etc.). If a file does not match any of the predefined extensions, it prints a message indicating that the file type is not included.
